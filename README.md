[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/newleaders/thincloud-authentication.png)](http://travis-ci.org/newleaders/thincloud-authentication) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/newleaders/thincloud-authentication)

## Description

A Rails Engine to provide authentication for Thincloud applications.

## Requirements

This gem requires Rails 3.2+ and has been tested on the following versions:

* 3.2

This gem has been tested against the following Ruby versions:

* MRI 1.9.2
* MRI 1.9.3
* JRuby 1.6+ (with `JRUBY_OPTS=--1.9`)
* Rubinius 2.0.0dev (with `RBXOPT=-X19`)

This gem has been tested against the following database versions:

* MySQL 5.0, 5.5
* PostgreSQL 9.1, 9.2
* SQLite 3


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem "thincloud-authentication"
```

* Run `bundle`
* Copy the migrations and prepare your databases:

```
$ rake thincloud_authentication:install:migrations db:migrate db:test:prepare
```

* Mount the engine in your `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
mount Thincloud::Authentication::Engine => "/auth", as: "auth_engine"
```

Using the example above, you may now login or signup at [http://lvh.me:3000/auth](http://lvh.me:3000/auth).


## Configuration

The `Thincloud::Authentication` module accepts a `configure` block with options to specify additional provider strategies. Add a key to the `providers` hash with the name of the strategy, followed by additional options for `scopes` and `fields` as needed. Additionally, you will need to provide environment variables (prefixed with the provider name), with the `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret` values from your OAuth provider.

To enable the [LinkedIn](https://github.com/skorks/omniauth-linkedin) provider:

* Provide values for `ENV["LINKEDIN_CONSUMER_KEY"]` and `ENV["LINKEDIN_CONSUMER_SECRET"]`
* Add the file `config/initializers/thincloud_authentication.rb` with the following contents:

```ruby
Thincloud::Authentication.configure do |config|
  config.providers[:linkedin] = {
    scopes: "r_emailaddress r_basicprofile",
    fields: ["id", "email-address", "first-name", "last-name", "headline",
             "industry", "picture-url", "location", "public-profile-url"]
  }
end
```


### Vanity Routes

If you want to customize the routes (remove the `/auth` prefix), you may add the following to your `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
get "signup", to: "thincloud/authentication/registrations#new", as: "signup"
get "login", to: "thincloud/authentication/sessions#new", as: "login"
delete "logout", to: "thincloud/authentication/sessions#destroy", as: "logout"
```

Using the example above, you will have the following routes locally:

* `signup_url` points to "/signup"
* `login_url` points to "/login"
* `logout_url` points to "/logout" - Make sure to use the `delete` method to logout.


## TODO

* Add "forgot password" functionality
* Add multiple, configurable strategy options
* Add a configuration option to customize the mailers
